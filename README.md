# qa_with_llm
- In this repo I am doing some test/experiments of using llamaindex.
- The goal is to try to use llamaindex to create various types for indices, and perform RAG.
- While trying to do this I am using locally hosted open-source LLMs (using OLLAMA).
- I am trying/evaluating LLMs that are available directly on OLLAMA model library, or downloading the ones that seem interesting on HuggingFace and `creating` new models from them using the OLLAMA's Modelfile.
